  Cyacq Corp, an investor group bidding
  for Cyclops Corp, said it amended its outstanding 92.50 dlrs a
  share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and
  modify a third one.
      The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a
  unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI>, said it also obtained additional
  financing commitments, including an increased commitment from
  Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
      The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for
  non-public information about Cyclops that was previously
  provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that
  the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's
  published financial projections.
      Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a
  90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons
  said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.
      The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be
  satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons
  were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have
  paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the
  consummation of Cyacq's offer.
      Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on
  April three, 1987, unless extended.
      Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business
  Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln
  dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln
  dlrs from 250 mln dlrs.
      Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have
  increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the
  new total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.
      Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy
  all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees
  and expenses.
      It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5
  mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.
      All previously announced conditions regarding the lending
  group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except
  that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq
  of equity contributions and other financing of not less than
  210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs
  for the merger facility.
      Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no
  indications of interest in an alternative offer it had made
  from Dixons, Cyclops or Alleghany Corp &lt;Y>, which has agreed to
  acquire Cyclops' industrial group from Dixons.
      Under the alternative offer, the Citicorp unit, with

  likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact.

      In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no

18,"JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS
  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip
  exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a
  U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese
  chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
      A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
  issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
  authorised exporters.
      Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be
  required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
  not automatically be denied licences, he said.
      But some industry officials predicted any government
  measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
  world semiconductor market remained weak.
      U.S. Government and industry officials have complained
  repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
  cost to third countries despite the July agreement.
      Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
  cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
  third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
  low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs
  and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
      The MITI spokesman said, ""If the percentage of grey market
  is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
  distributing their products through their sales network knowing
  they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask
  them what they are doing to reduce the figure.""
      MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
  10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
      But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. ""As long
  as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market
  prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to
  make money,"" a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said.

19,"KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS
  Eastman Kodak Co said it will
  reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber
  operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
      A company spokesman said the company will take ""some
  writeoff"" in connection with the action in the first quarter
  and there will probably be a further ""carryover"" writeoff in
  the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
  plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
  with the staff cuts.
      Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
  polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
  Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
  mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
  mostly in Columbia.
      The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
  Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
  and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
  Kingsport, Tenn.
      Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
  through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
  for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
  Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
  Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
  completed by April 30.
      Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
  have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
  production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
  business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
  since last year.
      The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
  polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
  500 mln due to lesser demand.
      It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
  in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
      Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
  units affected about 10,800.
      The company spokesman later said the charges will be
  insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

      Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program will

  of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid

      The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially
  ends at the close of the business day on March 30.
      USDA will release its official signup report around April

21,"ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET
  The shareholders of Illinois
  Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many
  Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote
  Wednesday on its possible dissolution.
      The directors of the company called a special meeting and
  recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume
  and increasing costs.
      Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout
  of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital
  stock, led to the call for dissolution.
      The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing
  houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional
  and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.
      Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm
  cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded
  Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.
      But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer
  Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through
  a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.
      With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade
  futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president
  of the co-op.
      Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a
  cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A
  notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became
  affiliated with Cargill, Inc.
      Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional
  cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,
  of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries
  in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and
  Harvest States in Minneapolis.
      Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative
  Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.
      Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives
  are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one
  cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.
      Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm
  cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few
  major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.
      Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the
  National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives
  exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.
      ""The period we've gone through in the past five years has
  been quite a crunch,"" he said. ""There's been a lot of
  consolidation in the marketing co-ops.""
      One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the
  major commercials for export, rather than exporting it
  themselves, losing potential profits.
      But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the
  multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers
  Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served ""to make
  folks gun-shy,"" Hanes said.
      Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is
  approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather
  than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.
      A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm
  ""was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of
  money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of
  doing business.""
      ""We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,"" he said.
  ""But there are lot of people out there to do business with.
  There are plenty of capable firms.""
      Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing
  with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures
  through a Chicago-based cooperative.
      ""In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to
  individuals, there would be economic savings,"" he said but
  added, ""The times change and with changing times, come
  different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.""
      Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had
  nothing to do with its profitability. ""I would guarantee you
  that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy
  organization.""
      In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois
  Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'
  equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for
  the most recent year has not been filed.
      Under the cooperative system, income from operations is
  returned as ""patronage refunds"" to the members.
      Income and refunds in the past five years have been
  declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op
  reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0
  mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,
  1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.
      ""You're dealing with substantially lower volume,"" Mulligan
  said. ""Lower volume translates into higher costs.""
      According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark
  owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common
  shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.
      Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital
  Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the
  figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.
  Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume
  and, as a result, changes from year to year.
      However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet
  minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark
  pulled out.

  Heavy buying by speculators boosted
  Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash
  tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV>.
      ""It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria,"" said one arbitrageur,
  referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per
  share and ended when ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> found a white knight
  willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.
      For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed
  like an ""appropriate price."" Another said ""it's too early to
  project the outcome.""
      ""The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
  offer is inadequate,"" the second arbitrageur said. But he added
  it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
  than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
      He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
  there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
  able to thwart Mark IV.
      Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
  studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
  would make a recommendation by April 17.
      A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
  several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
  determined bidder. ""They're not beginners,"" he said.
      Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
  another buyer. ""It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,""
  he said. ""There is only a small universe of people who would
  want to own the company as it's presently structured.""
      Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,
  aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding
  equipment and other products.
      ""I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
  those who can take the risk,"" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at
  Milwaukee Co.
      He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV ""fair value but on
  the low side."" ""I don't think management was looking for a
  buyer in any way before this offer,"" he said.
      Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has
  developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche
  markets. He said management has done a good job of turning
  around the telephone answering machine business.

  About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000
  seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping
  companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at
  strike headquarters said today.
      The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.
      The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro,
  said 126 ships were strike-bound.
      He added that because of resignations by many seamen there
  were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.
      The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct
  with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association
  Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.
      While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters
  say the problems have been manageable.
      ""It hasn't been critical by any means,"" said a coffee trader
  in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign
  ships.
      Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports
  served to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which
  last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments
  on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.

  Thailand's improving economy will likely
  cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion
  dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at
  end-February, private bankers said.
      Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to
  3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.
      Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank
  Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively
  high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,
  and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,
  contributed to the projected sharp rise.
      Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to
  expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.
      A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could
  achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up
  from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.
      Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its
  current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable
  the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.
      Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,
  special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target
  is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.

33,"COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY
  The International Cocoa Organization
  (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with
  many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.
      ""Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in
  place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation
  Monday,"" a consumer delegate said. ""The atmosphere is excellent.""
      Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be
  operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1,
  if the rules are agreed by Friday.
      A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy
  and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group
  this afternoon -- a big step toward a ""very interesting stage of
  negotiations,"" delegates said.
      The package, based on negotiating principles informally
  agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during
  fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
  Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.
      Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are
  scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly
  tomorrow.
      Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy
  cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer
  system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when
  he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage
  desired, delegates said.
      The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather
  than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference
  to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials
  would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to
  determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various
  cocoas from different origins, they said.
      The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a
  member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,
  the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority
  vote of the ICCO council.
      Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would
  not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they
  said.
      The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per
  day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,
  intermediate and forward positions, they added.
      One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is
  ""transparency,"" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's
  market activities will be public and he will have as little
  discretion as possible, delegates said.
      After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the
  International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa
  delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market
  mechanism, they said.
       Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to
  begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the
  approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to
  adjourn, delegates said.
      The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when
  the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The
  existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in
  place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable
  until rules are agreed.
       Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the
  last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,
  producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing
  mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,
  delegates said.

35,"PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986
  The state oil company Petroeleos de
  Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from
  oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by
  almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines
  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.
      Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual
  assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had
  dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last
  year's 13.3 billion.
      Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66
  billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34
  pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact on
  Venezuela.""
      PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of
  which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined
  products.
      The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd
  and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not
  enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price
  from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.
      The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher
  than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.
  Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting
  system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining
  and marketing operations.
      Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from
  323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,
  Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep
  gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.
      Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels
  in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of
  Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's
  production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of
  which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.
       Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986
  were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the
  world, Hernandez said.

  Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength
  and improving near-term earnings performance through operating
  expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company
  said in the annual report.
      Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on
  capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648
  mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell
  to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27
  dlrs share in the prior year.
      Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from
  the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should
  the investment climate improve and the belief that low or
  volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next
  several years.
      The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to
  restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show
  benefits in 1987.
      During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and
  marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of
  workers by 16 pct to 12,500.
      Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report
  that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward
  movement in international oil prices will be sustained.
      ""It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the
  company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals
  of market supply and demand,"" he said.
      Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products
  division are more promising than before, but are still
  uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln
  dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its
  petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in
  the United States.
      The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes
  said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as
  long as economic growth continues, but future large grain
  surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure
  on prices.
      Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,
  compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.

      The transaction is expected to be completed by September

      CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from
  the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings
  can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
  completed, it said.
      The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings
  should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital
  expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
  divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
  European business.
      The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
  in November, CPC said.
      Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
  in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
  baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
  part of the restructuring.
      As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its
  common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a
  total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual
  report.
      In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
  total of about 170 mln dlrs.
      CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
  wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,
  including that incurred under the share buyback.
      In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
  stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it
  authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.
      The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
  November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,

  CPC's then outstanding stock.
      In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales

  The U.S. House Foreign Affairs
  Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now

      The Democratic-controlled committee said the
  administration's export control policies, which restrict
  shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's
  record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.
      The committee said the legislation will cut government red

  foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available
  from other countries.
      Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic

      The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and

  William Bywater, president of the

      He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the
  semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from
  becoming ""one of the world's industrial lightweights.""
      Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy
  Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what
  sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged 
  violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
      The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end
  selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home
  market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego
  antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.
      But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped
  dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country
  dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
      Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,
  ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to
  force prices up and end the dumping.
      Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science
  Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new
  electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the
  U.S. industory more competitive.
      But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to
  pass and that action was required now to help the depressed
  electronic industry.

77,"DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION
  Central bank intervention in the
  foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's
  losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency
  is headed for a further retreat.
      Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive
  that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of
  commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.
      Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over
  the currency market than central bank intervention and these
  argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.
      ""The market can be bigger than the central banks. And
  economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said a
  dealer at one major U.S. bank.
      As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the
  yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,
  Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the
  markets on behalf of the U.S. currency.
      Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar
  recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from
  the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still
  failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.
      Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5
  billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars
  yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.
      Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the
  Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen
  today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased
  a small amount of dollars for yen.
      The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28
  when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of
  Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have
  signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.
      The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February
  22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
  France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate
  to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.
      But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by
  the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften
  extreme moves in the market.
      For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's
  purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than
  for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  
  watered-down American commitment to the currency accord.
      The Bank of England's action also was thought to be
  completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing
  the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six
  nations in its support of the currency pact.
      ""No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other
  two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than
  anything else,"" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.
      ""I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,"" said
  Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. 
  ""It's a yen problem more than anything else.""
      Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist
  sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American
  authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.
      ""The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the
  Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on
  its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,""
  said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.
      Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets
  are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official
  denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a
  lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.
      The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade
  deficit in 1986 was with Japan.
      Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on
  Sunday that the February currency pact had not established
  dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the
  U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.
      ""The dollar still has more room on the downside against the
  yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The
  currency market is becoming very political,"" said Natsuo Okada
  of Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
      Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen
  this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end
  of April or early May.
      Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their
  economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic
  imbalances in the near future, dealers said.
      ""Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it
  won't be enough to help the trade situation much,"" said
  Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to
  148 yen in the next couple of days.

  The Philippines must devalue the peso if
  it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning
  Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.
      ""The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports
  more competitive,"" Monsod said an interview. ""No question about
  it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South
  Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies
  deliberately undervalued their currencies.""
      The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is
  currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.
      Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does
  not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and
  able to continue to respond to market conditions.
      Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from
  the point of view of finance. ""If the dollar rate goes higher,
  our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the
  financing is very difficult,"" she said. ""But I am looking at it
  in terms of the economy.""
      She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.
      ""I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to
  become uncompetitive because then we are dead.""
      Monsod said, ""The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is
  a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)
  of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic
  thing.""
      Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct
  in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was
  expected to touch five pct this year.
      He said the government and the International Monetary Fund
  had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.

      It said that on that date, it will deposit with an escrow

  shares of its common for distribution.
      Company officials were not immediately available for

      As previously reported, Charter settled dioxin-related
  claims for about 1,200 individuals and the state of Missouri,
  resolving claims against it and all subsidiaries except
  Independent Petrochemical.
      Charter said some of the settlements remain subject to
  appeals and final court approvals and resolve claims against
  charter and its subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical.
      It said about 500 individual claims against it and certain
  of its units remain pending as disputed claims in bankruptcy

      Charter said its two creditors, an equity committee in its

  Resorts International Inc
  said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc> under which
  holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
  in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
  formed through the takeover.
      Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
  would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
  common stock in the new company.
      Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
  Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
  corporation.
      Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
  be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
  mln dlrs of equity.
      It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
  special preferred stock.
      The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
  commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
  preferred stock.
      Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
  It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
  to advise its board on the offer.
      Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
  certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
  shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
  a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
  752,297 class B shares outstanding.
      Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
  class B shares outstanding.
      Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
  class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
  power of the class B shares.
      Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
  by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.
      Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
  class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
  the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
  Resorts.
      Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
  merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
  special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
  exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
      This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
  the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
  operations.
      A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
  two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
  because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
  asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
      The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
  that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
  Denver oilman.
      Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles

  The chairman of the Federal Reserve
  Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House
  Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals
  scheduled for consideration Wednesday.
      Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a
  proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries
  that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government
  debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms
  abroad.
      He added, ""even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to
  be particularly directed,"" has started opening its markets.
      In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also
  said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries
  by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to
  commercial banks, was a problem.
      ""I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine
  the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to
  achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the
  policies that are followed on servicing external debt,"" Volcker
  said.
      It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to
  extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.
      Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary
  James Baker ""about the inappropriateness of using public
  resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we
  both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international
  debt facility.""
      He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures
  for international negotiations on currency exchange rates ""is
  unrealistic and could well have damaging effects.""
      ""For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations
  in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar
  -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference
  among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially
  destabilizing market expectations,"" Volcker said.
      He recommended ""we should not lock ourselves into formalized
  procedures for international negotiations"" on exchange rates but
  instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting
  in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives
  and those of major trade allies.

  U.S. corn acreage this year is 
  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
  acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
  of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
  years, Agriculture Department officials said.
      USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.
  Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will
  likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,
  down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.
      Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn
  production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987
  corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
  around seven billion bushels.
      Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
  program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
  program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain
  analysts said.
      ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
  corn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to not
  go along with the program this year.""
      Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
  at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.
      Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they
  said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.
      If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the
  drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
  farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.
      Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A
  severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
  yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2
  billion bushels.
      Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts
  said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
  bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.
      ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
  reduction in production,"" an analyst said.
      A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.
  corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not
  increase significantly, a specialist said.
      High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
  greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical
  participation in government programs, analysts said.
      In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
  in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
  corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.
      ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,""
  he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
  higher-producing delta areas.
      Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's
  2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.
      U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in
  1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has
  steadily declined in the 1980's.
      U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in
  the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The
  highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
  kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
  acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.
      Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields
  averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.
      ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
  bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said.
      Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
  long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts
  said.
      Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
  set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
  for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
  pct of their acreage.
      ""To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to
  provide more incentives,"" an analyst said.

  to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including
  the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.
      Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to
  recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading
  practices.
      Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
  is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to
  broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be

  producers and processors from Canadian imports.
      The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),
  would clarify the definition of ""industry"" in determining whether
  or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.
      Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the
  International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live
  swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming
  U.S. producers.

  The United States may soon ease its
  1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing
  forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the
  fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman
  representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.
      Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House
  subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the
  easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about
  the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.
      ""With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one
  mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean
  countries and the Philippines,"" Huckaby said.
      By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the
  quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.
      Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third
  quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September
  to December period ""we could get away without having to
  increase the quota.""
      He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an
  increase in the quota is justified.
      Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar
  refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to
  request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners
  said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive
  there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later
  this year, a refiner spokesman said.
      However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it
  would consider the request.
      Following the refiners' request, representatives of the
  Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition
  to any quota expansion, industry sources said.
      The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a
  sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of
  the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower
  officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the
  import quota, industry officials said.
      Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the
  Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.

  ""As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year

116,"CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. POTASH ACTION
  External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
  today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action
  against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against
  raising the alarm too early in the dispute.
      In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,
  the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously
  Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million
  U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.
      ""We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that
  Canadian interests are well protected,"" Clark told the House of
  Commons in the daily question period.
      But he said the opposition parties should be careful ""not
  to raise false alarms too early.""
      The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's
  trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash
  producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government
  subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.
      Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8
  mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third
  going to the U.S.
      Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,
  comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.
      In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the
  ruling as just another ""trade harrassment"" from the U.S. and
  criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be
  protected.
      ""We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the
  softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,""
  Axworthy said.
      Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to
  impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier
  this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with
  the U.S.
      Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to
  world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
  and Trade.
      But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example
  of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral
  irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the
  U.S.
      ""What we are seeking to do is put in place a better
  system,"" Clark said.
      Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed
  confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem
  stems from low international commodity prices and not
  government subsidies.
      ""The reality of the problem and the injury is caused
  worldwide,"" he said. ""It's caused by a downturn in the
  commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,
  nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.""

137,"MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS
  Automobile dealerships have become
  large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
  billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
      Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
  buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
  largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
  say.
      Retail car sales ""are at a point of transition. There's not
  much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking"" about
  ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
  of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
      The retail car market is ""much more freeform now"" than it
  was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
  analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
      Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
  Dealerships sold one kind of car--a ""Chevy"" or a Ford or a
  Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
  738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
  Automobile Dealers Association.
      That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
  Beatle--began to gain popularity. The ""Bug"" caused ""a
  rebellion"" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
  restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
  says Jauppi.
      One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
  been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
  the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
  increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
      ""I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
  dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,""
  says Cole.
      ""There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
  make cars,"" he says.
      With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
  up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
  will let up.
      Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
  Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
  1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
  principal owners today.
      Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
  franchises, some of which might compete against each other. ""It
  used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
  Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,"" Jauppi says.
      As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
  the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
  or open international operations.
      Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
  ""are obviously thinking of very seriously,"" says Cole.
      Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
  of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
  trading in car dealer shares.
      ""Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
  the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
  cars. It could happen any time,"" Jauppi says.
      ""If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
  scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
  resist taking them public,"" said another analyst.
      And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
  international.
      ""We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
  that are worldwide,"" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
  particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
  than the U.S., he says.
      ""It's not totally off the wall,"" says Cole.

      Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash
  for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due
  2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners
  Ltd.
     The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln

  company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and
  Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to
  Chapman.
      Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of
  the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest
  and control of the board.
      In addition, Chapman and Troon will establish a 10 mln dlrs
  acquisition joint ventures, it said.
      The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan
  providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate
  balance of 22.4 mln dlrs.
      The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of
  preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three
  shares of common stock.

  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
  agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
      Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
  economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
  fundamentals.
      Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
  bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
  agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
  to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
  necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
  likely.
      But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
  levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
  currencies around their then current levels.
      Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
  the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
  yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
  nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
  surrounding trade tensions.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
  that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
  dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
  U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
      The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
  moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
  He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
  remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
  rise of the yen.
      The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
  in line with the Paris accord, he added.

  A strong performance by its retail
  businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings
  Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in
  1986, stock analysts said.
      They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of
  between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln
  in 1985.
      The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay
  a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a
  share in 1985.
      James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's
  1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income
  to retail sales.
      Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its
  franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury
  goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.
      Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine
  Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he
  estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465
  mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.
      But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35
  pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to
  about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.
      The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong
  Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.
      Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as
  a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book
  revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the
  year as part of its retail business, which will increase its
  overall retail income figures.
      Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply
  increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct
  share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.
      Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986
  of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.
      Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments
  of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln
  dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about
  the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.
      But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln
  dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.
      Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations
  that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its
  diverse interests.
      It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both
  Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine
  Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.
      A company statement issued last month said the firm will
  use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an
  additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.
      Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake
  in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is
  likely to develop its own business, analysts said.
      ""The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability
  to creatively structure some new acquisitions,"" said Hargreaves
  of Hoare Govett.
      He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key
  sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its
  existing business.

159,"CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT
  China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen
  International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about
  14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of
  operation.
      General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit
  forecast, saying targets were under study.
      Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's
  outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,
  up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings
  rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.
      Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent
  company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen
  International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso
  International Bank Ltd> in Macao.
      The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985
  but did not officially open until March 1986.
      Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign
  partner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut
  last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign
  banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three
  Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.
      Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were
  unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a
  loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of
  268,000 dlrs in 1985.
      The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of
  China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,
  Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and
  Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).
      One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the
  same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on
  unequal terms with state-owned banks.
      The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost
  saturated, he added.
      Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted
  from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the
  foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced
  internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
      Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International
  Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the
  state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight
  foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong
  Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

  The yen could rise to 140 yen to the
  dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.
      Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan
  Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told
  reporters: ""The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).
  The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy
  is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan).""
      ""The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.
  Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the
  American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,"" he
  said.
      To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,
  Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,
  including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.
      He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for
  wage increases this year as a means of raising private
  consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.
      ""We have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said.
      He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing
  the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition
  to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market
  manufacturers through cheap imports.
      Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki
  said.
      Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a
  downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service
  industries, he said.
      It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully
  employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he
  said.
      Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in
  the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible
  recession in the Japanese economy, he said.
      Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond
  levels experienced in 1986.
      The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week
  the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance
  since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil
  price crisis.
      In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the
  economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land
  and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with
  steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

  The Food Department will no longer

178,"MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES
  Middle East currency dealers meet in
  Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their
  business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from
  the Arab world to London.
      The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association
  also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf
  currency system is more real that at any time this decade.
      Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these
  issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to
  be major talking points.
      About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --
  including some in London and other major non-Arab financial
  centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins
  on on Saturday.
      Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a
  growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,
  by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in
  London.
      The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,
  foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in
  Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based
  banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.
      As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade
  finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain
  ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.
  Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.
      The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab
  Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased
  their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading
  representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.
      One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book in
  London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...
  There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.""
      Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit
  taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,
  &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November
  1986.
      The major market maker has traditionally been London-based
  consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom
  joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its
  London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.
      One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably the
  volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new
  licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most
  of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.""
      Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi
  riyal market is difficult to quantify.
      Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency
  deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped
  to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986
  from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.
      The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal
  trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very
  quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now
  staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect
  &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.
      Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market
  moving completely out of the region, partly because of local
  demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian
  Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate
  internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue
  speculation.
      There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market
  shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain
  and London is still limited.
      But for the first time since the formation of the six
  nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs
  that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.
      Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final
  currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,
  Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
      But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary
  System style with a common peg have been discussed at high
  level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected
  to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.
      One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given to
  discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the
  end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.""
      One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.
      The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated
  since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently
  linked to a basket of currencies while the other five
  currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation
  against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,
  but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of
  7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.
      Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued
  slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the
  undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

  profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
      The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
  domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
      It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
  mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
  possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
  because of recent declines in raw material prices.
      Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
  prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
      It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
  share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
  largely by family foundations.

201,"MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT
  Governments of major Asian
  producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new
  International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and
  traders are unhappy with the development, according to views
  polled by Reuter correspondents.
      Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which
  produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the
  new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber
  industries remain viable in the long-term.
      But traders and growers said they were against the new pact
  because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere
  with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.
      The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on
  October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's
  producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.
      It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in
  New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter
  into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting
  for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.
      Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
  the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of
  liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber
  and a possible depression of prices.
      He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to
  keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose
  or fell through its buffer stock system.
      Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of
  purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a
  contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done
  through direct cash contributions from members, he said.
      Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to
  finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed
  with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become
  indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International
  Tin Agreement.
      ""This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out
  without any financial encumbrance,"" Lim said.
       Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking
  cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers
  and consumers would also become members, he said.
      Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit
  to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.
      It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because
  its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.
      Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new
  pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt
  the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market
  operations.
       Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free
  rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at
  levels that were only acceptable to consumers.
      ""With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable
  level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,
  while producers may never see sharp price rises,"" a Malaysian
  Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters.
      Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the
  overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had
  psychologically prevented price rises, he said.
      State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had
  been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a
  buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.
      Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was
  expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.
      Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be
  pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to
  stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers
  to produce more.
      Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's
  conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to
  allow sharp price fluctuations in future.
      ""The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be
  liquidated and a free market returned,"" a Malaysian trader said.
      Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success
  as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they
  questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers
  to finance buffer stock operations.

  Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects
  continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
  problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
      He told reporters:""1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
  Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
  Properties expects further good results both from properties
  under development for sale and from its investment property
  portfolio.""
      He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
  company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
  billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
      Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
  mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
  Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
      Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
  business, primarily in Hong Kong.
      Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
  70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
  pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
  enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
  and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
  profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
      Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
  flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
      He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of ""a
  marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
  savings in fuel costs.""
      ""At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
  for the rest of this year,"" he said, ""though there might be a bit
  of increase later this year.''
      Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
  operations, even though the marine sector is generally
  depressed. ""Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
  better,"" he said.
      The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
  revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
  an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
      Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
  but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
  project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
  island now near completion.
      He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard

  Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh
  oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last
  November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are
  ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry
  sources said.
      They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise

  subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the
  reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.

  quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
  platform.
      Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
  but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
      Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume
  at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
  the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.
      The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in

  said.
      Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab

      It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
  year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
  also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and
  greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
      Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per

  proposed dividend imputation laws.
      This would make five cents for the year against a first and
  final of one cent in 1985.
      Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer
  from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian
  dollar had helped earnings.
      Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint
  venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand

  The yen could rise to 140 yen to the

      Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan
  Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told
  reporters: ""The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).
  The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy
  is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan).""
      ""The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.
  Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the
  American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,"" he
  said.
      To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,
  Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,
  including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.
      He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for
  wage increases this year as a means of raising private
  consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.
      ""We have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said.
      He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing
  the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition
  to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market
  manufacturers through cheap imports.
      Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki
  said.
      Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a
  downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service
  industries, he said.
      It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully
  employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he
  said.
      Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in
  the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible
  recession in the Japanese economy, he said.
      Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond
  levels experienced in 1986.
      The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week
  the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance
  since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil
  price crisis.
      In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the
  economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land
  and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with
  steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

  after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985.
      The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
  earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
  analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln.
      CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
  later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
  to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free
  to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
  full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid.
      The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
  fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
  the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.
      Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
  dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
  legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
      Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor
  year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
  gold producers.
      Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars
  declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
      Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
  and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
  substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.
      World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have
  steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
  but overcapacity continues, CRA said.

  Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs

      Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs

      Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
  against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
  from 2.8 mln.
      CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
  amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
      CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
  losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
      Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for

  future tax provisions, CRA said.
      Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
  before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The
  strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
  issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
  to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.

233,"CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.
  China called on the United States to
  remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
  status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
      But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
  13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
  inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
  Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
       The official International Business newspaper today
  published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
  visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
       ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
  restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
  for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
  exports,"" the editorial said.
       ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
  favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
  into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
       ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
  recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
  influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added
       The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
  counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
  that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing
  bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
       He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
  technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
       The paper also printed a table showing that, since
  bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
  year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
  at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
       A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
  Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
  goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
  U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
       He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
  have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
  laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
       The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
  Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not be
  dominated or controlled by international Communism.""
       The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
  of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
  there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
  them.
       China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
  involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
  which the U.S. Side won, he said.
       But, for the first time, China signed last week an
  agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
  exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
  lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
       Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
  voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
  bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
       ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
  about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
  centralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said.
       Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
  GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
  or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
       In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
  Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
  China's interest in participating in GATT.
       ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
  overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
  economy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said.
       ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
  discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
  enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
  develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
  benefit from its GATT participation,"" he said.
       The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
  are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
  regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
  for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
       In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
  last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
  system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance
  planning"" and economic levers.
       The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
  do.

236,"OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT
  Papua New Guinea
  (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the
  Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun
  Fesharaki said here.
      The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG
  on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told
  the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual
  conference.
      Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West
  Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific
  petroleum outlook.
      With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,
  PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki
  said.
      The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best
  oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.
      The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper
  distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at
  about 500 mln barrels.
      PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with
  no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.
      ""We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and
  discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to
  (light) Bass Strait crude,"" Fesharaki said.
      There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to
  be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is
  capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.
      But prices should be somewhat higher than the present
  levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.
      The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large
  prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.

  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
  tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
  16 billion marks from the system.
      The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
  close banks here this afternoon.
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
      But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
      ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
      ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer,"" he added.
      An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
  marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
      Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
  clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

      Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil

  to receive operatorships following France's agreement last
  autumn to purchase gas from Norway's Troll field, were not

  Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including
  the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S

  the licence with Statoil.

  with partners Statoil, Norsk Agip A/S, Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group's &lt;RD.AS> A/S Norske Shell and &lt;Deminex> unit Deminex

      Statoil has been offered the operatorship on a new block in
  the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of
  Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and
  &lt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA> (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the
  block.
      Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks
  opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks
  were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks.
      Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8,
  sharing the licence with Exxon Corp's &lt;XON.N> Norwegian
  subsidiary Esso Norge A/S, The British Petroleum Co PLC's
  &lt;BP.L> BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd, Shell, Norsk
  Hydro and Saga Petroleum A/S &lt;SAGP.OL>.
      Blocks 7219/9 and 7220/7 were awarded to Norsk Hydro, the
  operator, Statoil, Mobil Corp's &lt;MOB.N> Mobil Exploration
  Norway, Petrofina SA's &lt;PETB.BR> Norske Fina A/S and BP.
      The third Barents Sea licence, covering blocks 7124/3 and

  Atlantic Richfield Co's &lt;ARC.N> Arco Norge A/S, Total Marine

      The oil ministry withheld awards on four strategic blocks
  included in the eleventh round's second phase.
      The ministry is accepting applications for phase two blocks
  until early April and the awards will likely be announced this
  summer, officials said.

  influence production decisions by oil companies operating in

  daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit

      Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall
  in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as
  in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.
      British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to
  increase in the future, she said.

  The Bundesbank bought large amounts
  of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar
  above 149 yen, dealers said.
      The dollar intervention was in concert with some other
  central banks, they said.
      Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England
  supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that
  these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active
  yesterday.
      The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.
      Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination
  of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges
  following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading
  countries to foster currency stability.
      One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the
  Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy
  dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.
      He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the
  situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with
  other central banks.
      Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had
  until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above
  150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test
  central banks' resolve to defend currency stability.
      But the test came this week with the dollar falling below
  1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute
  between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the
  dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.
  Trade deficit were behind the weakness.
      This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared
  to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.
      Dealers said it was significant the West German and British
  central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.
      That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by
  central banks to foster currency stability, they said.
      But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged

  South Africa's new foreign debt
  agreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, but
  bankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of
  anxiety from a still depressed economy.
      ""We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence'
  yet,"" commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having
  marginal influence on fundamental economic problems.
      Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the
  main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and
  financial rand.
      The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,
  rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumped
  nearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.
      All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take
  place through the financial rand, which is considered the main
  barometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseas
  investors.
      Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains
  in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.
  Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.
      They said the financial rand in particular was being driven
  by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could
  favorably affect the currency.
      Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan
  balances and short-term claims into equity investments in South
  Africa.
      Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank
  was ""investigating the implications of such conversions in light
  of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system.""
      Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said
  the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that
  ""some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view
  of South Africa.""
      Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay
  1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the
  next three years. The agreement extends a standstill
  arrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place since
  August, 1985.
      Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed
  their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the
  monetary authorities.
      ""They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we
  offered the minimum,"" said one banking source, reacting to
  reports from London that creditors were hoping for larger
  repayments.
      Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa
  should have ""no difficulty whatsoever"" with the terms.
      Economists said the debt agreement would have no
  significant impact on economic problems continuing to face
  South Africa including high rates of inflation and
  unemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.
      Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speaking
  yesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was ""in
  bad shape"" and there was ""an awful lot of talk but little action""
  to cure serious problems.

  Britain's gold and currency reserves
  showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
  72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
      The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
  operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
  borrowings and repayments.
      This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
      The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
  of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
  and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
      Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
  billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
      Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
  36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
  repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
  Treasury spokesman said.
      Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
  capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
  change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
  quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
  swap.
      The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
  market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
  of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
  today.
      A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,

  high level in February, latest figures received by the
  International Sugar Organization (ISO) show.
      The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnes
  raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said this
  was a new peak for the date.
      Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000
  in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current
  crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply
  after March, but in recent years production from March to the
  end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.
      Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and
  consumption 57,800.
      Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87
  production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln
  in 1985/86.

  Trade house sources said China is

      The consensus is that the Chinese will buy between 200,000

  The U.S. Senate Agriculture
  Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and
  aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation,
  credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.
      The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade
  missions made up of representatives of the Departments of
  Agriculture and State, the Agency for International
  Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market
  development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.
      At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year
  after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.
  programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export
  Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and
  export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).
      The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,
  offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have
  required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one
  mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.
      Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes
  of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food
  donation program.
      The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed
  increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up
  to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.
      The committee also dropped a provision identifying which
  countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.
      Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries ""friendly
  to the United States"" would be eligible to host the trade
  missions.
      Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,
  the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,
  Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,
  Tunisia and Morocco.
      The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural
  Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during
  fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time
  employees, a FAS spokesman said.

  BAT Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L> 1986 results,
  which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the
  company was in a strong position and that its shares were
  probably undervalued, share analysts said.
      BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading
  after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p
  earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39
  billion pre-tax.
      Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock
  market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
  shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the
  share price.
      ""In the current market, people almost expect companies to
  beat expectations,"" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits
  of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.
      BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985
  pretax profit of 1.17 billion.
      Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its
  underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
  tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.
      BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
  tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
  pct four years ago.
      Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
  declining further as other sectors increased in importance.
      He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
  services, in particular in the U.S.
      Sheehy also said the group had ""no sizeable acquisitions"" in
  sight in the near future.
      Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the
  U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.
      Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16
  pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
  major acquisitions, they said.

  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
  tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
  16 billion marks from the system.
      The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
  close banks here this afternoon.
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
      But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
      ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
      ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer,"" he added.
      An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
  marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
      Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
  clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

  Energy Secretary John Herrington has
  proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said
  all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close
  White House scrutiny before action is taken.
      One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion
  allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as
  production using enhanced extraction methods.
      Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.
  The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the
  tax code, but would look at the proposal.
      Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along
  with the release last week of the energy department's report on
  energy and the national security.
      The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit
  50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging
  implications for national security.
      He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that
  any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production
  would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not
  cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.
      Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,
  spurring production but fail the second and third.
      He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil 
  workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil
  prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide
  and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.
      A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria
  by not increasing domestic production.
      In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains
  firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.
      Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:
      - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by
  borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if
  oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that
  could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.
      - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It
  would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000
  barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.
      - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical
  expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a
  day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.
      - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to
  spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for
  the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower
  the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.
      Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration
  proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut
  the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.
      He also called again for Congressional approval to explore
  off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion
  barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
  may hold nine billion barrels.
      Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to 
  amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these
  proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security
  study would make a strong case for the need to help the
  struggling domestic oil industry.
      Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even
  though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to
  raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
  100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.
      This, he said, would further bolster national security in
  case of an oil-supply disruption.

  Canada's federal government
  will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that
  includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a
  company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy
  Minister Marcel Masse announced.
      The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into
  the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one
  billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.
      The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on
  or after April 1, 1987.
      Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid
  package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.
      The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and
  Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments
  that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.
      Masse said the program will probably generate new
  employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.
      He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and
  development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil
  prices fell during the first half of 1986.
      Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided
  to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying
  companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full
  value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately
  benefit from tax benefits, he said.
      The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid
  program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
  is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax
  reform proposals later this spring.
      An important feature of the aid program is a decision to
  let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to
  benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to
  only participating companies, he said.
      Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it
  easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and
  development, Masse said.
      He told reporters his department is still considering
  whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for
  the subsidy.

  A leading U.S. farm-state
  Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next
  year for legislation to control domestic production of
  sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry
  fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.
      ""We're moving toward a direction where we could
  self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),"" Rep. Huckaby, chairman
  of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar
  issues, told Reuters in an interview.
      Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year
  they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the
  same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also
  said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.
      Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic
  sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further
  cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.
      ""I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)
  another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point
  where the program might not work,"" he said.
      ""Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,""
  said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.
      A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the
  current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the
  U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports
  holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.
      A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made
  until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.
      ""I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could
  probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through
  the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),""
  Huckaby said.
      However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup
  producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener
  market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.
      He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will
  capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in
  the U.S.
      But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the
  production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further
  expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports
  might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.
      Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner
  companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.
      ""This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have
  some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the
  program is preserved,"" Huckaby said.
      Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to
  think about how domestic output could be controlled, either
  through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.
      Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the
  Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask
  corn refiners to limit production.
      ""I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do
  there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do
  that legally?"" he said.
      Asked if he would proceed with production controls without
  the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said ""You build a fragile
  house if you do it that way.""
      Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers
  have expanded production, because high sugar price support
  means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such
  as soybeans and grain.
      But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would
  not be good policy.
      Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to
  sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they
  may be penalized retroactively under any production control
  legislation passed next year.
      Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in
  the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration
  proposal to drastically slash the program.
      ""The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't
  think it will get up a head of steam,"" Huckaby said.
      He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price
  support is unlikely to be approved.
      Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,
  Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint
  with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the
  European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the
  major cause of the depressed world sugar market.

  Brazil's labour unrest is spreading,
  with many banks, universities and government statistical
  offices on strike and more pay disputes looming.
      Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launched
  yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly
  salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000
  workforce.
      The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo
  and Rio de Janeiro.
      For the government the one positive development on the
  labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's
  40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.
      A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half
  the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies
  and that the strike looked close to an end.
      Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank
  strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil's
  crisis-laden economy.
      ""If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a
  serious effect because normal financial operations will grind
  to a halt,"" said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.
      Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal
  universities launched a national strike, with a broad political
  demand as well as a pay claim.
      David Fleischer, head of the political science department
  in Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Association
  of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional
  inquiry into what had happened to government education funds.
      He said the universities were strapped for cash and that
  the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition
  government, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using education
  funds for projects which had helped their candidates in
  elections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.
      Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the

  Opec remains within its agreed output

  Energy Minister Subroto said.
      He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that
  present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of
  warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for
  oil.
      Prices had also been forced down because refineries were
  using up old stock, he said.

  ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:
  ""Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)."" He did not elaborate.
      He said there appeared to have been some attempts to

406,"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER
  Argentine grain producers again
  reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
  soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
  trade sources said.
      They said growers now forecast soybean production this
  season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
  estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
  tonnes forecast in mid-February.
      The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
  total production.
      Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
  7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
  for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
  mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
      Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
  in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
  provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
      The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
  and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
  pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
  3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
  record of 3.34 mln hectares.
      The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
  last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
  damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
      Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
  beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
      The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
  southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
  influence production forecasts.
      In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
  rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
  and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
      The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
  rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
  Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
      The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
  3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
  hectares in 1985/86.
      The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
  between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
      This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
  12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
  and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
      The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
  area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
  although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
      A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
  impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
  sunshine dries the fields.
      The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
  29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
      Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
  to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln tonnes.
      The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
  rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
  in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
      The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
  pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
      Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
  22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

  The chairman of the U.S. Senate
  committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned
  about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by
  the Canadian House of Commons last week.
      The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading
  agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian
  political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing
  systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.
      Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the
  resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free
  trade agreement between the two countries, which are each
  other's largest trading partners.
      ""We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both
  countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually
  beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,"" the Texas
  Democrat said in a statement.
      ""I do not question Canada's right to protect its political
  sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases
  mean the government of Canada means to take important economic
  issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply
  concerned,"" he added.
      Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while
  the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He
  said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get
  rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair
  and might not win Senate approval.
      ""I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime
  Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with
  this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did
  when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial
  agreement will be successful,"" Bentsen said.
      Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in
  Ottawa.
      Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would
  ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by
  non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist
  measure.

  Columbia Gas System Inc said a

      The company said ""this could bring earnings for 1987 below

      It said management expects to recommend to the board that

      Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
  offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
  liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
      The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
  higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
  Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of

  Canada may begin monitoring steel

      The officials, asking not to be identified, said the
  government will investigate an industry contention that steel 
  imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being
  diverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns about
  the level of Canadian exports south of the border.
      But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,
  said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan
  Administration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal
  limits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.
      ""In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,""
  said one official who claimed Canadian companies were ""fair
  traders"" in the big American market.
      If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a 
  monitoring system will be established in the next three or four
  months.
      ""I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would
  have to do something about it,"" said a trade official.
      Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
  of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level
  just two years ago.
      The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
  growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
  several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel
  producers.
      Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
  American market be limited to 2.4 per cent.
      The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign
  companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.
  Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw
  steel, which makes up less than half the steel market.
      Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in

  International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,
  Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to
  reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International
  Cocoa Agreement.
      Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among
  producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding
  differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can
  purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin
  cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.
      Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations
  individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.
      Producers and consumers indicated support ""in principle"" for
  the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past
  week by a small working group, consumer delegates said.
      Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident
  a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the
  council session ends, but certain technical points need further
  clarification, the delegates said.
      Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included
  in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market
  realities, consumer delegates said.
      Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote
  purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are
  normally required by manufacturers, they said.
      Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa
  might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would
  depress prices, they added.

  &lt;SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings
  to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last
  year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last
  year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the

      SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction
  group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer
  last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals

      Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will
  account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping
  to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and
  construction acivities, Taylor said.
      Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small
  extraordinary gain.
      In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
  about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and

  The Securities Industry Association
  backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
  corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
  trading in law.
      The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
  firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
  guard against illegal trading by employees.
      The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
  variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
      But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
  continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
  activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
      The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
  directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
  Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
  exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
      The report said securities firms ""should be more rigorous in
  restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.""
      It said firms should train their employees to understand
  the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
      It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
  expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
      It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
  securities firm from liability for law violations by its
  employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
  the wrongdoing.
      In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
  advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
  protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
      It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
  should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
  acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
  current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
  exceeding the five pct limit.
      The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
  company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
  offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
  limit on open market purchases.
      The group said the federal government should preempt state
  regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
      The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
  least 30 calendar days.
      The current requirement is expressed in business days.
      It said so-called ""lockup"" devices, in which securities are
  issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
  off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
  target company's total common stock.
      Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
  out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
  America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
  and fairness in the marketplace.

  Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves
  declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward
  revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its
  annual report said.
      The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as
  was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of
  the judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco on
  charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire
  Getty Oil Co.
      The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the
  company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in
  this case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having to
  seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the
  bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the
  federal bankruptcy code.
      Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced
  Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,
  Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the
  appeals court no later than March 30.
      Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company
  and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels
  at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.
      However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern
  Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the
  decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of
  1985.
      Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries
  declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and
  upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln
  barrels from 117 mln, respectively.
      Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United
  States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from
  1.55 billion.
      The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000
  barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with
  about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --
  representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in
  response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.
      Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion
  cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at
  the end of 1985.

      In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
  regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
  dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
  1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
  debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
  within an acceptable range.
      In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
  listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
  43.7 pct in 1985.
      In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
  dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
  in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
  dlrs.
      Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
  negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
  investment tax credits.
      By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
  tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
  cash flow.
      In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
  gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
  increase in long distance calling volumes.
      Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
  lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
  expenditures were held below budget.

      In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations,

  nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa
  and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United

      The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's
  steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,
  increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in

  Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
  takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
  and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
  brokers said.
      They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
  announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
  Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
  Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
  billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
      Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
  on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
  But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
  from Liang as long term investment.
      He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
  Hk Hotels.""
      Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
  redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
  hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
  Hk Hotels.
      &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
  pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
      Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
  on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
      ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said.
      But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
  group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
  up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
      Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
  analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
  Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
      Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
  the Hk Hotels board.
      A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
  not considered any countermoves so far.
      Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
  Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
  styles.
      ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
  property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
  fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
  not to be named.
      Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
  distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
  only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
  Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
  current trading price.
      Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
  Ltd>.
      Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
  China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
  cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

  U.S. soybean lobbyists and
  congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
  Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.
  soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per
  bushel next year.
      ""I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.
  Politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a
  senior farm-state senator said.
      USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
  Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather
  than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.
      ""I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,""
  American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.
      Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
  the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider
  ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.
      His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
  administration's position is in the debate over what should be
  done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
  soybean farmers' income.
      Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the
  loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
  pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
  competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to
  maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move
  would be too costly.
      ""There will be alot of other options that will be
  considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz
  proposal,"" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan
  (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.
      ""Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
  would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
  loan,"" O'Conner said.
      Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
  decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr
  basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to
  increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.
  Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a
  soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or
  4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.

  Kansas City Southern Industries Inc
  said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific
  Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp &lt;SFX> if
  the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
  to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
  Santa Fe Railway.
      In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
  four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
      Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
  agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
  of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
  the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
  from today onward.
      ""We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
  offer in cash for the Southern Pacific,"" said Kansas City
  Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
  Rowland.
      ""This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
  Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
  Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
  Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'"" said Rowland.
      He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
  the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
  independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
  competitor, Santa Fe.
      Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
  value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
  1.2 billion dlrs.
      It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
  Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
  merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
  800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
      Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
  Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
      ""Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
  absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
  offer in writing...."" said the company.
      Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
  had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
  reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
  Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
  other throughout their routes.
      ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
  inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
  for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
  with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
  other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

  An investor group said it might be
  willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so
  far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.
      ""We might be able to see some additional value if we could
  meet"" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for
  the investor group.
      Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds
  ""was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this
  time."" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone
  conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.
      Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>,
  recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The
  offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.
      Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share
  tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp
  gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.
      Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his
  group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and
  entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He
  said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be
  more viable if merged with another tire company.
      ""One option would be to try to grow the tire business
  through combination or an acquisition,"" Reed said. He said he
  believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the
  tire industry.
      Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his
  company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and
  boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit
  sharing have been used with success, he said.
      In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,
  Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's
  shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.
      The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they
  intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc
  &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the
  station for 387 mln dlrs.
      The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would
  also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
  Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs
  and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would
  get about 103 mln dlrs.
      The partners also said the Federal Communications
  Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving
  comments on their request for special temporary authorization
  of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal
  application for transfer of the broadcast unit.
      Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule
  because it provides time for the agency to act on the request
  before the expiration of the tender offer.
      He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly
  as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.
      Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by
  some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is
  headquartered, Reed said, ""the plan of the partners offers long
  term growth for Ohio.""
      He noted that the aerospace business, slated for
  divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.
  ""Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest
  long term growth for all segments,"" he said.

  natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,
  down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.
      Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was
  12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in
  1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs
  per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.

      The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade

      The bill's many provisions also set as a priority for the

  government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations.
      In addition, the Banking Committee bill would authorize
  U.S. banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt
  problems of developing countries, such as lowering interest
  rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt
  forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any
  federal banking regulations that bar such actions.
      The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to
  discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility
  of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that
  would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the
  restructuring of the debt.

492,"COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS
  Congress, eager to find budget
  savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
  generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA
  and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how
  much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.
      The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that
  payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20
  pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked
  not to be identified said.
      USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying
  it did not take into account storage, handling and transport
  savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to
  re-examine the costs, sources said.
      The issue is an important one, because congressional budget
  committees are known to be considering limiting the use of
  certificates as a means of cutting spending.
      Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior
  Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the
  Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.
      Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are
  uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared
  to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,
  CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.
      USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents
  to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in
  government storage.
      It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative
  arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the
  government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm
  price and income support programs, Reagan administration
  sources said.
      The GAO is expected to point out that use of
  payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight
  storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been
  sold.
      The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director
  Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees
  intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal
  budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of
  PIK certificates.
      The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or
  certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to
  farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to
  repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or
  cash.
      Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion
  dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another
  6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and
  August 1987, according to USDA.
      Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily
  because recipients can use the certificates to pay back
  government loans at levels below the loan rate.
      Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would save
  the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to
  the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according
  to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates
  cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.
      The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be
  considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other
  savings alternatives.
      The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the
  estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date
  have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln
  dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one
  administration official said.
      However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates
  based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.
      The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable
  to the different effect certificates can have on market prices
  over the course of a crop year.
      USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found
  that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of
  corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by
  between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.
      Between September and November, however, certificates had
  only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS
  study, obtained by Reuters.

      ""I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a
  recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals,"" Baker told The Cable

      ""We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris
  otherwise we would not have been a party too it,"" he said.
      Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to
  ""co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around

      He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar
  rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently
  tended ""to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say.""
      Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as
  saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that
  triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.
      ""I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that
  international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,""

  partners grow as fast as they can.
      Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect
  of a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance,
  takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade
  deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to
  lower the dollar's value.

      Little progress was made in last night's three hours of

      ""There is still a very large gap between the employers and
  the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.

      ""If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to

512,"EC LINKS AGRICULTURAL TRADE TALKS TO OTHER REFORM
  The European Community (EC) considers
  talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
  on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
  Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
      He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
  reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
      He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
  agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
  agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
  lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
      Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
  round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
      De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
  conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
      Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
  saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
  urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
  also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
  reform was reached as early as possible.
      But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
  long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
      ""We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
  and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one
  undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no
  fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -
  and that's all,"" de Clercq said.
      ""If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my
  priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the
  only urgent thing,"" he said.
      He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months
  to prepare and eight days of negotiations.

  Engineering group Linde
  AG's &lt;LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in
  the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same
  1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.
      But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln
  marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
  exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
  incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
      Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
  year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
  1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
      Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
  394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
  period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
      Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
  to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
  nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
  issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
  currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.
      Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the
  necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
  acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
      While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
  marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
  billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
  the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
  orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
      World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
  pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
  739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.
      World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05
  billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05

      Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in
  the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and
  order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in
  the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders
  rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.
      The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group

","1,"
527,"BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES
  British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it
  intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
  Co &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
  a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
      The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>
  unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
  offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
  being tendered.
      BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
  on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
  advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
  non-public information.
      Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
  1-3/4 dlrs.
      BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
  last night's close.
      About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
  own resources.
      The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
  banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
  partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
  company said it was in the course of arranging these
  facilities.
      BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
  investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
  ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
  made without the limitations of a minority interest.
      BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
  use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
  were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
  investment.
      Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
  changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
  in a lower oil price environment.
      Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
  and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
  tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
      Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
  One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
  should spend so much money buying a company it already
  controlled.
      BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
  shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
      It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
  the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
  dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
  1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
      Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
  that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
  depend on the reaction of the markets.
      The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
  pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
      However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
  repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
  returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
  its cash flow -- were good.
      Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
      Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
  make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
  production and its downstream activities would push it
  comfortably into surplus.
      BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
  discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
  inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
  which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
  oil.
      The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
  reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
      The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
  now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
  tender offer, Spedding said.
      BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
  balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
  received in the markets.
      The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
  after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
  -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
  straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
  other sectors.

528,"HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES
  Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a
  statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
  fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
      The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
  other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
  on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
  crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
  polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
      World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
  1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
  billion from 42.72 billion.
      Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
  marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
      The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
  Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
      In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
  cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
  at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
  previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
  1986, Hoechst said.
      Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
  technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
      Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
  the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
  &lt;American Hoechst Corp>.
      Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
  restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
      Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
  partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
      Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
  profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
  from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
  extraordinary costs.
      The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
  compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
  currencies, Hoechst said.
      The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
  projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
  increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
  acquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.
      Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to

  Australia's largest company, The Broken

  profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first
  nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters

      This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the
  first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31
  1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.
      The analysts estimated that the group would report a third
  quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against
  238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.
      BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted
  to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.
      The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in
  petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting
  some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait
  fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and
  steel earnings.
      They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal
  prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been
  affected by industrial and production problems.
      The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's
  lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,
  and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around
  300 mln dlrs.
      One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a
  tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on
  capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.
      They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900
  mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from
  1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would
  be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.

      The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967

      A total of six of 10 indicators available for January

  were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer

  the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
  earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
  in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
  used to support that program.
      The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and
  the dealers have not yet been chosen.
      The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
  cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
  through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
  committed to the facility.
      Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
  Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
  BP's relationship banks.
      As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
  at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
  75 mln.
      Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
  extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
  to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
  compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
  which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
  10 days.

  The rebates granted at yesterday's EC

      They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency
  Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers
  claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered
  for sales into intervention.
      The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the
  level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week
  was 2.5 Ecus below this level.
      But the sources said producers who have offered a total of
  854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent
  attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum
  rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that
  they intend to withdraw these offers.
      The French and German operators involved would be able to
  withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the
  sugar will officially enter intervention stores.
      The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar
  going into intervention and payment being made for it.
      EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy
  the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move
  which could drive down market prices further.

  West Germany's current account
  surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February
  from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a
  spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.
      The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4
  billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.
      The Statistics Office had originally put the January
  current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.
      The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion
  mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current
  account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus
  recorded in February 1986.
      A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the
  February current account surplus compared with January was due
  to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account
  figures are seasonally adjusted.
      February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled
  32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986
  but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.
      Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56
  billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct
  compared with January.
      The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate
  the real change in exports and imports in February. But for
  comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value
  of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average
  value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.
      Within the current account, the services account had 300
  mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark
  surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark
  deficit.
      Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in
  value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a
  year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,
  a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.
      The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for
  January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1
  billion marks in the year-ago period.
      The cumulative current account surplus for January and
  February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion
  marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.
      Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus
  reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as
  seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier
  this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against
  January while export prices were unchanged.
      ""The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend
  that is not expected to change for several months at least,""
  said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987
  as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record
  112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the
  surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.
      An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in
  Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a
  more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.
      He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and
  February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus
  posted in November and December.
      ""The trend is clearly lower,"" he said.
      This economist, who declined to be named, said the February
  rise was also partly explained by special factors in January,
  when there had been a number of public holidays as well as
  extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

545,"JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND
  Japan's plan to cut beef intervention
  prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost
  demand because of strict supply controls and a complex
  distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.
      ""Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting
  consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,"" a
  Housewives Association of Japan official said.
      Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm
  markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which
  maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.
      Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the
  standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled
  beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against
  1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.
      The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from
  dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling
  at 1,325 against 1,420.
      Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock
  Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations
  to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention
  price zone.
      The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount
  set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale
  prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,
  both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when
  prices are below.
      But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef
  stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.
      Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export
  Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step
  toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about
  half those in Japan.
      But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.
  Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated
  distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.
      The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices
  are high mainly because of distribution problems and high
  production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.
      American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.
  Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan
  Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in
  the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

  will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp

      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he
  will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he
  visits here next month.
      In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by
  9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.
      In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from
  168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants
  to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.

  World group turnover of Siemens AG
  &lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
  year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
  months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
      Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
  billion marks.
      Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
  21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
  19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
  to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
  which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
      In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
  three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
      In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
  billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
      For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
  one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
      Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
  communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
  should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
      But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
  1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
  dollar, Kaske said.
      Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
  net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
  same period in the previous year.
      Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
  strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
  communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
  and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
      Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
  the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
  level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
  orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
      Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
  increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
  was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
      While the installations and automotive technology sector
  showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
  communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
  period of 1985/86.
      Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
  level.
      Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
  billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
  year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
  6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

  The Fried. Krupp GmbH
  &lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
  1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
  18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
      Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
  billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
  16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
      Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
  weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
  falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
      The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
  plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
      Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
  business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
  underpinned machinery and component activities.
      An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
  trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
  figures.
      However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positive
  results achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details.
      Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
  from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
  billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
  orders against 40 pct in 1985.
      Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
  member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
  rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
      The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
  end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
      Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
  three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
      The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
  mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
  foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
  industries.
      The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
  steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
  But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless

551,"NO PESSIMISM FOR GERMAN EXPORTERS, MINISTRY
  Firms need not be pessimistic about export
  prospects even though foreign markets have become more
  difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry
  said.
       The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg
  von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could
  start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the
  lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.
      But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no
  need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of
  exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.
      Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but
  noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. ""This
  is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for
  stimulative steps,"" he said.
      The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work
  actively to promote free world trade, he added.
      Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export
  opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in
  international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms
  have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery
  times and good service.
      Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult
  position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure
  to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried
  about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's
  exporters.
      Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,
  tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a
  record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was
  due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the
  decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have
  in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

552,"MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY
  The monetary authorities of the major
  industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as
  the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and
  widespread central bank intervention, dealers said.
      The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's
  Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West
  Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of
  the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza
  meeting to weaken the dollar, they said.
      The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was
  overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on
  different sides, dealers said.
      Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has
  encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite
  concerted intervention by the central banks of the United
  States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.
      Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for
  action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by
  comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was
  no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.
      Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris
  accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.
      The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul
  Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,
  which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a
  halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they
  noted.
      The situation has again raised the question of whether
  intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge
  currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to
  intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.
      ""This means that the current dollar selling is not of a
  sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,"" said Koichi
  Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.
      Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the
  intervention and it is only a matter of time before some
  operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in
  Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record
  low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.
      Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to
  rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven
  industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.
      The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus
  Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies
  apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.
      Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be
  used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris
  accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to
  prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.
  Trade deficit, especially with Japan.
      Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a
  lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.
      The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow
  the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said
  Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
      Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large
  forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills
  falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.
      The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen
  depreciation, dealers said.
      Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks
  ineffective in light of this real demand, they said.
      The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar
  sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new
  business year starting April 1, dealers said.
      ""The market seems to have established a new dollar trading
  range between 147 and 149 yen,"" one dealer said.
      The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris
  accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low
  end for the dollar against the yen, he said.
      Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148
  yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to
  145.

  Gross domestic product (GDP)
  growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct,
  up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.
      The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast
  made by the Treasury last October.
      Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross
  national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,
  after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.
      It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last
  November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and
  commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.
      Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated
  rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain
  their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.
      Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will
  average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm
  oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise
  of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.
      It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn
  around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in
  1986 and five pct in 1985.
      ""In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending
  is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under
  strict control... The resource gap in the government's finances
  on current account will be bridged over the near term,"" Bank

      The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19
  billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or
  2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.

  This morning's sharp decline in coffee
  prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations
  in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization,
  ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.
      ""The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the
  failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it
  will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices
  rise again,"" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters

      ""The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee
  available at present, there is a shortage of quality,"" he said.
      ""Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the
  news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to
  around 120 cents within a few weeks,"" the roaster added.
      Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries
  said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of
  consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota
  reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be
  reallocated on a more equitable basis.
      ""There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because
  the market is well balanced and we must not lose this
  opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement,"" he said.
      ""There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of
  clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not
  welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete
  renegotiation,"" de Vries added.
      With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have
  fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the
  foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a
  hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices
  were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

  Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed

      The current account balance of payments in February showed
  a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
  compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln

      Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
  billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
  record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
      Trade Department officials said the improvement in
  Britain's current account contrasted with most private
  forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
  rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
  expected.
      The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
  reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
  of catching up in the February figures.
      The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
  underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from

  The International Wheat Council (IWC)
  lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain
  production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared
  with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.
      In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving
  unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming
  1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a
  record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in
  1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.
  The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to
  87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.
      The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and
  coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln
  against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln
  rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.
      The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is
  likely to be down from last year as low world prices and
  restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.
      At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a
  drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There
  is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the
  IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.
      Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain
  outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the
  European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is
  expected lower but oat sowings could rise.
      After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union
  plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln
  hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are
  likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved
  weather and a further increase in the use of intensive
  cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet
  maize output in 1987, the IWC said.
      Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be
  bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC
  said.
      It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at
  endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln
  tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.
      After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln

  another large crop this coming season with higher output
  expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

  The release of U.K. February trade data
  showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
  mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
  of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
      Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
  expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
  mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
  narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
      ""The figures are unreservedly good,"" Chase Manhattan
  Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
      Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
  morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
  against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
  yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
      The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
  pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
  which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
  Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
  to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
  to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
      But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
      There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
  deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.
      Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February
  to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
      Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
      However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
  Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove
  partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
  Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer
  expenditure on imported goods.
      However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his
  firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
  forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
  stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
      He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
  confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
  Confederation of British Industry.
      The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
  January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
  goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers,
  Harwood said.
      U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
  point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
  about the figures evaporated.
      Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
  to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than
  the European low of 1.5960.
      However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
  sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
      Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
  largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
  Conservative government's support was slipping.

570,"IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED
  Efforts by governments to control wheat
  surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial
  success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its
  latest monthly report.
      Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing
  both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC
  says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat
  exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.
      In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,
  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export
  income, there may be problems in reducing production.
      A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to
  unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.
  Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then
  lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.
      The IWC outlines three courses of action open to
  governments in wheat exporting countries.
      They could continue to support prices in the hope that when
  the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and
  surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.
      Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which
  could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long
  period.
      This option may prove to be the most politically
  unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning
  wheat production, the report said.
      The third option would be for governments to distinguish
  between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,
  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or
  overall production.
      The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting
  countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the
  producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.
      These changes did not always result in lower export
  subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more
  than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.
      For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention
  price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European
  currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which
  most export transactions are denominated, the intervention
  price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of
  supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers
  and some governments are now searching for ways to cut
  expenditure, the report says.
      The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five
  major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey
  from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to
  increased production in China and India.
      The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was
  countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower
  acreages.
      In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per
  cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to
  other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.
  Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

      The current account balance of payments in February showed

      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln

  the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
  revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
  for the year.
      Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
  45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
  business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
  transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
  for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
      Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
  also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
  addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
      Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
  in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
  Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
  agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
  lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
      Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
  oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
  transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
      Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
  for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
  master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
  equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
  period for repayment starting in December 1988.
      The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
  a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
  Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the
  occurrence of certain events.
      Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
  about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
      Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
  to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
  its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
  lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
  It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
      Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000

  The release of U.K. February trade data
  showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
  mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
  of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
      Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
  expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
  mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
  narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
      ""The figures are unreservedly good,"" Chase Manhattan
  Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
      Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
  morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
  against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
  yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
      The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
  pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
  which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
  Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
  to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
  to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
      But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
      There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
  deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.
      Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in
  February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
      Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
      However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
  Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would
  prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
  Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture
  on imported goods.
      However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said
  his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
  forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
  stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
      He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
  confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
  Confederation of British Industry.
      The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
  January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
  goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,
  Harwood said.
      U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
  point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
  about the figures evaporated.
      Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
  to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher
  than the European low of 1.5960.
      However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
  sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
      Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
  largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
  Conservative government's support was slipping.
      The Marplan poll, published in ""Today,"" showed Conservative
  support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the
  Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31
  pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,
  whose own support fell from 38 pct.
      The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted
  enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left
  the voters indifferent, political observers said.
      Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn
  that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for
  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.
      This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which
  are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming
  general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,
  Harwood said. ""The news did come as a very, very substantial
  relief,"" he said.
      However, on the interest rate front, economists caution
  that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by
  encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had
  already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in
  response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for
  lower rates have been curtailed.

  Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
  U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
      ""A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
  exchanges,"" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
  further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
      Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
      Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
  investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
      Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
  exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
      Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
  foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
  poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
  of this year.
      The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
  ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
  430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

  Treasury Assistant Secretary David
  Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among
  six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange
  rate stability around current levels.
      In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking
  subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris
  that ""further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage
  growth and adjustment prospects.""
      But he also said while there are clear understandings among
  the countries regarding cooperation, ""We have refrained from
  establishing a system of target zones or ranges.""
      Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the
  way in which they intend to deal with possible market
  developments.
      He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with
  exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid
  exchange rate objectives ""or to specify too precisely the goals
  of intervention"" would hurt official attempts to react to
  market pressures, he said.
      Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency
  objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would
  be counterproductive.
      Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the
  Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline
  from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this
  year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18
  months.
      But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by

  enhance U.S. competitiveness.

  American Eagle gold bullion coin
  sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year
  on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope,
  director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.
      World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193
  mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world
  market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.
      Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold
  Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in
  Europe and about eight pct in Asia.
      She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion
  coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve
  the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.
      The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,
  as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining
  gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the
  open market, Pope said.
      Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here
  from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from
  the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's
  West German market share at 60 pct.
      The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy
  gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct
  value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce
  coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.
      Competition may also come from new gold coins, including
  Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia
  also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.

  Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and
  output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson
  Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market
  which details cost and demand factors.
      Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in
  recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered
  by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material
  increasingly attractive.
      It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity
  to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around
  550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.
      On the demand side, developments in automobiles and
  packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.
      Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,
  is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the
  foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings
  is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,
  particularly in the U.S.
      In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to
  dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major
  economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is
  evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.
      In addition to the cost savings involved, technology
  advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by
  the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.
      There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the
  U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of

646,"DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL
  A large Dutch animal feed compounder
  will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test
  case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied,
  a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het
  Comite, told Reuters.
      Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against
  alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,
  since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with
  the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.
      The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account
  of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders
  in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in
  their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another
  country.
      Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that
  companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy
  rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain
  commodity board.
      The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and
  legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration
  Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.
      The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company
  for the test case from among the 80 lodged ""because the bill
  (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the
  levy contained significant currency distortions and involved
  grain from a wide variety of origins."" The name of the company
  is not being made public.
      The Administration Court is not expected to make a final
  ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman
  said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal
  Court in Luxembourg, and ""as a result it could easily be another
  nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.""
      Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are
  putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch
  government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a
  complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is
  collected, the spokesman said.
      Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of
  European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions
  protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.

  Treasury Assistant Secretary David
  Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial

  markets over the next few months.
      He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five
  nations and Canada agreed in Paris to ""see if there can't be a
  period of reasonable stability instead of volatility"" to give
  time for the committments in Paris to take place.
      Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention
  was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that
  the administration judged that after economic adjustments,
  current exchange rates reflect underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In particular, the stability sought by the nations would
  allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies
  domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford
  said in his testimony.
      He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would
  hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.
      Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was
  affected by international developments.
      He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would
  result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily
  lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm
  asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.
      Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, ""I think
  exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and
  Japan's) efforts can be carried out.
      Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic
  growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower
  dollar.
      Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern
  of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade
  deficit.
      Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved
  either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both
  alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.

      Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and

  The Bank of France intervened to buy

  stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of
  Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign
  exchange dealers said.
      But they said recent central bank intervention in the
  foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to
  temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.
      A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources
  close to the central bank said it had also intervened
  yesterday.
      Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with
  the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan.
      The sources said the French central bank could have been in
  the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily
  on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising
  from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31.
      One major French bank said it bought between five and 15
  mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the
  dollar.
      Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France
  to say it was in the market, a departure from the central
  bank's usual insistence on confidentiality.
      But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,
  which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.
      ""Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would
  still be talking of a small overall amount,"" said one dealer.
      Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to
  have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for
  yen. ""This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a
  wider trend,"" the dealer said.
      Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the
  dollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and
  Japanese yen.
      These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement
  reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the
  Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and
  Canada.
      But speculative pressures started to build again this week
  after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as
  repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for
  the dollar.
      Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking

676,"COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE
  International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,
  council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise
  proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer
  delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates
  said.
      Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major
  producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding
  differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa
  the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for
  different varieties.
      Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be
  worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.
      Some consuming member nations, including Britain and
  Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct
  non-member cocoa, delegates have said.
      The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality
  non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most
  effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is
  currently pressuring the market.
      Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up
  at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say
  Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it
  is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa
  Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.
      As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher
  differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent
  proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa
  bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.
      Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way
  that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more
  expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.
      Other technical points need to be sorted out, including
  limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in
  nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent
  effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

  Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph
  Corp's &lt;T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications
  firm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.
      Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
  acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
  Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided
  on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
      The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
  at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
  The result of the negotiations was still open.
      Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
      The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
  James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
  and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
  U.S.
      Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
  the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
  switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
      The French government has limited CGCT participation by
  foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
  for the whole company.
      Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
  initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
  said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
      Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm
  &lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of
  March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
  form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.
     Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while
  Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln
  francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre
  with was also being planned.

693,"GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS
  The Bundesbank's options for West
  Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
  by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
  employers, economists and money market dealers said.
      Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to
  3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct
  treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.
      But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
  to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
  fear of upsetting the current wage round.
      One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""I
  don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
  happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it
  wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.""
      In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground
  for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
  of growth and inflation, economists said.
      Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the
  Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,
  raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
  medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.
      As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
  that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.
      In the current round, the country's most powerful union,
  the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is
  demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
  present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.
      The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is
  offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give
  a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this
  year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
      The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest
  union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the
  benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
  public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations
  began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
  early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.
      Though many economists said the unions' current warning
  strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
  would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week
  strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on
  their positions and there could still be conflict.
      This could extend the length of time in which the
  Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.
      The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the
  protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
  housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.
      ""The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this
  squarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said.
      In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall
  union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than
  his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
  to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.
      More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in
  south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
  yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
  aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.
      Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in
  warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.
      Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
  would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
  a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.
      About eight billion marks were coming into the market
  tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.
      As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer
  to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,
  anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.
      But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
  was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of
  liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,
  perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.
      Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average
  52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
  24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

  Less than two months after First
  Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
  Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
  but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
      In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
  ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
  ""so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
  independence, if possible.""
      In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
  East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
      First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
  the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
  states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
      Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
  large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
  lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
      While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
  asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
  ""That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
  not to think that.""
      Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
  ""opportunistic"".
      He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
  he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
  profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
  already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
      The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
  of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
  at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
      Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
  him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, ""We
  continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
  people continue to monitor and look at us.""
      Banking analysts, however, consider another First
  Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
  any time soon.
      Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
  billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, ""a very,
  very difficult decision.""
      With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
  Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
  four position in the California banking community.
      ""The competition in this state is tough,"" he said, noting
  CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
  from Sears Roebuck company. ""CityBank is moving rapidly to move
  us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,"" he said.
      Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
  Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
  Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
  competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
      ""Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
  profitable and obviously well managed company,"" he said.
      He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
  advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
  and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
  banks a common name.
      Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
  financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
  serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
  real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
      Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
  he said, ""I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
  most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
  estate problems are going to be with us for several years.""
      Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
  the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
  franchise operation.
      First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
  Interstate financial services in ten states.
      While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
  operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
  most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
  the Midwest must come first.
      Calling the franchise system, ""moderately profitable,""
  Pinola said, ""It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
  agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
  we were generating before the last year or two.""
      On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
  1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
  with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.
